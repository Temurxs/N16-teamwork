1. Data types - primitive and non-primitive

Primitive - String, Number, Boolean, BigInt, Symbol, Undefined, Null
Non-primitve - Object , (Array)

2.  Variables : let, const, var
Differences:
1. var - new variable can be created with the same name
2. the values of var and let can be changed 
3. Hoisting works with only var 
4.Only var can impact outside a block scope

3.While Loop in Programming:
The condition is checked before the execution of the loop body.

Do While Loop in Programming:
The loop body is executed at least once, regardless of the condition.
After the first execution, the condition is checked.

4.Object.values, 
object.entries
Object.keys
Object.assign
Object,create

5. Array join()
Array pop()
Array push()
Array length
Array toString()
Array at()
Array shift()
Array unshift()
Array delete()
Array concat()

6.A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

7.Pure functions return the same output if we use the same input parameters. However, impure functions give different outcomes when we pass the same arguments multiple times


8.String toUpperCase()
String toLowerCase()
String concat()
String trim()
String trimStart()
String trimEnd()
String padStart()
String padEnd()
String repeat()
String replace()

9.The basic idea behind call/apply/bind is the same: explicitly set function parameters including this

10. Use Object when:
You’re dealing with static, simple structured data.
You need JSON-like structures.
Use Map when:
You need keys that aren’t just strings.
You care about the insertion order.
You need high-performance key-value storage.
You need to frequently add/remove key-value pairs.

11.Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic

12. Encapsulation   Abstraction	     Inheritance	      Polymorphism


13.Key Differences Between typeof and instanceof
Purpose:
typeof: Determines the primitive type of a variable.
instanceof: Checks if an object is an instance of a specific constructor or class.
Return Value:
typeof: Returns a string (e.g., 'number', 'string').
instanceof: Returns a boolean (true or false).
Scope of Operation:
typeof: Works on both primitive values and objects but is less informative with objects.
instanceof: Works only with objects and checks the prototype chain.
Identifying Arrays and Functions:
typeof [] returns 'object', while [] instanceof Array returns true.
typeof function() {} returns 'function', which is a subtype of 'object'.


14.Promise.then() takes two arguments, a callback for success and another for failure.

Both are optional, so you can add a callback for success or failure only.

15. Promise.then,
    Promise.catch,
    Promise.all,
    Promise.catch


16.The event loop is a component of the JavaScript engine that manages the execution of code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks

17. CRUD 
  Create -> post
  Read -> get
  Update -> put 
  Delete -> delete

18. The HTML DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that represents the structure of a web page in a way that programming languages like JavaScript can understand and manipulate.
addEventListener
"click"
"dblclick"
"mousedown"
"mouseup"
"mouseenter"
"mouseleave"
"mouseover"
"mouseout"
"contextmenu"
